# lystra.html

So, you have all these oggs or mp3s you ripped from the CDs you used to buy lying on a server in your home network and you want to play them from the android tv box, the laptop in the coffee table and the old ipad in the kitchen.
But just surfing in on the server gives you a html listing per folder.

Drop lystra.html in the root folder of your music collection and surf to it.
It will fetch the directory listing of the folder where it lies and present you with a music browser where you can queue up tracks, play/pause etc.

All in html5.
